<h1>Hi there!</h1>

Fancy some API Documentation?

<ul>
    <li><a href="api-guide.html">An example of what an API guide might look like.</a></li>
    <li><a href="getting-started-guide.html">An example of what a getting started guide might look like.</a></li>
</ul>

You can write the docs using asciidoc (adoc) format. Spring REST Docs writes 'snippets' which you are free to `include` wherever you like in your adoc files.

<blockquote>Note: If you run the server from your IDE you may not get any docs being served because the regular build steps can get bypassed by the IDE. Just run `gradle clean build bootRun`. </blockquote>
